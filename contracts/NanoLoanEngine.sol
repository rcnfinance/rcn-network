        lender when the loan starts. If there is no cosigner, the fee must be 0.
        @param _currency The currency to use in the Oracle, if there is no Oracle, this field must remain empty.

        Ej: interestRate 11108571428571 = 28% Anual interest
        @param _duesIn The time in seconds that the borrower has in order to pay the debt after the lender lends the money.
        @param _cancelableAt Delta in seconds specifying how much interest should be added in advance, if the borrower pays 
        entirely or partially the loan before this term, no extra interest will be deducted.
