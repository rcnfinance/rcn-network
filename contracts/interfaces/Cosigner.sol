    The cosigner is an agent that gives an insurance to the lender in the event of a defaulted loan, the confitions
    of the insurance and the cost of the given are defined by the cosigner.

    The lender will decide what cosigner to use, if any; the address of the cosigner and the valid data provided by the
    agent should be passed as params when the lender calls the "lend" method on the engine.

    When the default conditions defined by the cosigner aligns with the status of the loan, the lender of the engine
    should be able to call the "claim" method to receive the benefit; the cosigner can define aditional requirements to
    call this method, like the transfer of the ownership of the loan.
