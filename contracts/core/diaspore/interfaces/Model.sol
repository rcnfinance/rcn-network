/**
    The abstract contract Model defines the whole lifecycle of a debt on the DebtEngine.

    Models can be used without previous approbation, this is meant
    to avoid centralization on the development of RCN; this implies that not all models are secure.
    Models can have back-doors, bugs and they have not guarantee of being autonomous.

    The DebtEngine is meant to be the User of this model,
    so all the methods with the ability to perform state changes should only be callable by the DebtEngine.

    All models should implement the 0xaf498c35 interface.
